During a reaction, atoms are rearranged but not created or destroyed. Chemical reactions are everywhere: burning wood, cooking food, rusting iron, and digestion in our bodies. Reactions can release energy (exothermic) or absorb energy (endothermic). Understanding chemical reactions is essential to chemistry and helps explain how matter changes.","chemical reaction,chemistry,reactants,products,bonds,transformation",academic_curriculum,2025-10-29T09:25:11.900019,0.95
14,chemistry,What is the periodic table?,"The periodic table is an organized chart of all known chemical elements arranged by atomic number (number of protons). Elements are grouped into columns called groups, which share similar chemical properties, and rows called periods. The table was created by Dmitri Mendeleev and helps scientists predict how elements will behave and interact. It includes metals, nonmetals, and metalloids. The periodic table is one of the most important tools in chemistry and shows patterns in element properties.","periodic table,chemistry,elements,mendeleev,atomic number,organization",academic_curriculum,2025-10-29T09:25:11.900039,0.95
15,english,What is a noun?,"A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are one of the main parts of speech in English grammar. There are several types of nouns: common nouns (like dog, city, book), proper nouns (names like London, Shakespeare), abstract nouns (ideas like happiness, freedom), and collective nouns (groups like team, family). Nouns can be singular or plural, and they function as subjects or objects in sentences. Understanding nouns is fundamental to constructing sentences.","noun,english,grammar,language,parts of speech,word",academic_curriculum,2025-10-29T09:25:11.900060,0.95
16,english,What is a verb?,"A verb is a word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. Verbs are essential to sentences because they tell us what is happening. Action verbs describe what someone or something does (run, write, think). Linking verbs connect the subject to additional information (is, am, seems). Helping verbs work with main verbs (can, will, have). Verbs change form based on tense (past, present, future) and subject. Every complete sentence needs a verb.","verb,english,grammar,action,language,sentence,tense",academic_curriculum,2025-10-29T09:25:11.900079,0.95
17,english,What is a metaphor?,"A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares two different things by stating that one thing is another, without using 'like' or 'as'. For example, 'Time is money' or 'Her voice is music to my ears'. Metaphors create vivid images and help readers understand complex ideas by comparing them to familiar things. They are common in poetry, literature, and everyday speech. Metaphors make language more interesting and expressive. Understanding metaphors improves comprehension and writing skills.","metaphor,english,literature,figurative language,comparison,poetry",academic_curriculum,2025-10-29T09:25:11.900097,0.95
